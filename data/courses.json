We will cover React JS on the front-end and NodeJS + MongoDB on the backend. We will go through how a rest api works, how APIs are used all over the web today to power multi-platform applications and build a few along the way. ",

        "This course will start with an introduction to python programming. The course covers all the topics needed to be a good backend developer. On the scripting part, we cover Linux and shell scripting. We also go through the basics of github. We start with setting up the environment using python, pip and pycharm. We go through how a rest api works and also implement few of them. Our database lessons will include, mongoDb and SQL and we also teach some basics in cloud computing like EC2, dynamoDb, RDS, S3 etc. This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods.The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics.The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled.Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described.The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques,such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models.By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised(classification) and unsupervised(clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need,and write python code to carry out an analysis",
